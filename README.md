# Deepfake Video Detection using ResNeXt-50
<center><h2>Deep Fake Shield</h2></center>


## Overview
This project aims to detect deepfake videos using advanced deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging the ResNeXt-50 model architecture. Deepfake videos, which are highly realistic but fabricated using AI algorithms, pose a significant threat to the authenticity of visual media content. By developing a robust framework for classifying videos as real or fake, we contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat the proliferation of misinformation and preserve the integrity of digital media platforms.

## Features

- Utilizes the Celeb-DF-v2 dataset, comprising a 6000+ diverse collection of real and synthesized videos featuring celebrity personas.
- Implements the ResNeXt-50 model architecture for video classification.
- Provides functionality for preprocessing videos, extracting frames, and applying data augmentation techniques.
- Offers inference capabilities for detecting deepfake videos in real time.
- Includes example scripts for training the model and evaluating its performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torch-vision
- Timm
- OpenCV
- PIL
