# Deepfake Video Detection using ResNeXt-50
<center><h2>Deep Fake Shield</h2></center>


## Overview
This project aims to detect deepfake videos using advanced deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging the ResNeXt-50 model architecture. Deepfake videos, which are highly realistic but fabricated using AI algorithms, pose a significant threat to the authenticity of visual media content. By developing a robust framework for classifying videos as real or fake, we contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat the proliferation of misinformation and preserve the integrity of digital media platforms.
